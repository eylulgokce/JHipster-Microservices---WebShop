Bachelor Thesis Project Outline: Evaluating Data Management

Patterns in Microservice-Based Applications
A bachelor thesis is generally structured into three broad phases:
- an early/introductory part, including literature research and analysis, first contact with the
thesis subject, questions, issues and planning
- a design and implementation phase, including prototyping, iterative implementation and
testing, and ironing out of any problems
- a final phase including the finalization of the implementation and the writing and
presentation of the thesis
It is recommended that you keep detailed notes during the entire process, and send frequent status
updates and/or arrange meetings with your supervisors when confronted with problems or major
decision points to elicit feedback and suggestions.

1) As a first step, you will be sent some literature to study. Useful reference links are the following:
- https://microservices.io/
- http://microservicepatterns.org/overview
- https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html

To familiarize yourself with the concept of microservices and test out related technologies, you will
be required to first implement a prototype microservice-based application based on the typical
scenario of e.g., web store. This must include the management of customers as well as
products/merchandise, order and payment transactions, and shipping (this is an example, if you
decide to proceed with us we will provide you with a more detailed example). No structural patterns
are as yet required; the application should comprise only microservices directly communicating
with each other. For this early prototype, you can analyze the scenario and resolve on which entities
and functions to include in each microservice as you see fit. You can also incorporate ancillary
services (e.g. authentication) but this is not required.
For the implementation of the prototype and the next steps, we recommend you use JHipster
(https://www.jhipster.tech/), but you are free to use any other framework you are familiar with. .
The successful implementation of this prototype will serve as the first milestone of your thesis.

2) The next step involves the further elaboration of the prototype through the implementation of
structural patterns, resulting in a set of similar applications on the same scenario, differentiated by
their structure. These prototype applications will then be tested in a variety of load and scaling
scenarios and their performance compared, in order to evaluate the impact of the structural patterns
on performance. Be aware that this is an iterative and time-consuming process, so reserve adequate
time to do this properly.

3) Once the evaluation phase is completed, the observations made and lessons learned will be
assessed, and presented in the final thesis report. The deliverables at the end of the project include
the implemented prototypes as well as the written thesis.
