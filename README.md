# Microservices---WebShop

To familiarize yourself with the concept of microservices and test out related technologies, you will
be required to first implement a prototype microservice-based application based on the typical
scenario of e.g., web store. This must include the management of customers as well as
products/merchandise, order and payment transactions, and shipping (this is an example, if you
decide to proceed with us we will provide you with a more detailed example). No structural patterns
are as yet required; the application should comprise only microservices directly communicating
with each other. For this early prototype, you can analyze the scenario and resolve on which entities
and functions to include in each microservice as you see fit. You can also incorporate ancillary
services (e.g. authentication) but this is not required.

The next step involves the further elaboration of the prototype through the implementation of
structural patterns, resulting in a set of similar applications on the same scenario, differentiated by
their structure. These prototype applications will then be tested in a variety of load and scaling
scenarios and their performance compared, in order to evaluate the impact of the structural patterns
on performance. Be aware that this is an iterative and time-consuming process, so reserve adequate
time to do this properly.

TODOs:
- database per Service
- One Database for all Services
- Message Broker
- Performance testing
